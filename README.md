# PDIN

#### Pretty Directory Indexing for Nginx

Directory listings generated by web servers aren't ever pretty. Those generated by nginx are no exception, so I decided to look for an alternative. Adam Whitcroft made [Apaxy](https://github.com/AdamWhitcroft/Apaxy) at some point, but that only covers Apache. I built PDIN, on top of [ngx-fancyindex](#installation), in order to make directory listings look nice when using a more light-weight server as well.

## Installation

As mentioned, PDIN is built on top of ngx-fancyindex, which will need to be installed. Thanks to the way nginx handles modules, you'll probably need to recompile the server software. A brief tutorial for installation of Fancy Index can be found in its repo's readme [here](https://github.com/aperezdc/ngx-fancyindex#building), but I might right a more detailed one for Ubuntu/Debian at some point (I'll link if I do).

Once you have Fancy Index working, clone this repository into a directory you want to be prettified. Any directory below that will be covered automatically. Next alter your nginx configuration to enable the fancy listings.
